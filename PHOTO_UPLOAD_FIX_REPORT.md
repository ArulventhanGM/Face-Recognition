# Photo Upload Functionality - Issue Resolution Report

## 🚀 **RESOLVED: Photo Upload in Add Student Page**

### **Issues Found & Fixed:**

#### ❌ **Issue 1: Missing Server-Side Validation**
**Problem**: When no photo was uploaded, the backend didn't validate that a photo is required for new students.

**Root Cause**: The code checked `if 'face_image' in request.files:` but didn't handle the case where the field exists but no file is selected.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive server-side validation:
```python
# Check if face image is required (for new students)
if 'face_image' in request.files:
    file = request.files['face_image']
    if file and file.filename:
        # Process file...
    else:
        # No file uploaded but face_image field exists
        flash('Face photo is required for new student registration', 'error')
        return render_template('add_student.html')
else:
    # face_image field not in request at all
    flash('Face photo is required for new student registration', 'error')
    return render_template('add_student.html')
```
