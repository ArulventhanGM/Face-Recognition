3. **Upload Training Images**: Select 3-10 photos of the same person
   - Different angles (front, slight left/right)
   - Various lighting conditions
   - Different expressions
   - Clear, high-quality images
4. **Start Training**: Click "Start Training" to begin the process
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the real-time progress modal
6. **Review Results**: Check training accuracy and statistics

### For New Students:

1. **Access New Person Training**: Use the "Train New Person" form
2. **Enter Student Details**: Fill in ID, name, email, department, year
3. **Upload Training Images**: Select multiple photos (minimum 3)
4. **Register & Train**: Click "Register & Train" to create the student and train recognition
5. **Verify Results**: Check the training results and test recognition

### Managing Trained Faces:

1. **View Training Statistics**: See overview of all trained faces
2. **Test Recognition**: Use the "Test" button to verify accuracy
3. **Retrain if Needed**: Add more photos or retrain existing faces
4. **Delete Training Data**: Remove training data if needed
5. **Export Data**: Download training metadata for backup

## üéØ Training Best Practices

### Photo Quality Guidelines:
- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (minimum 640x480)
- **Lighting**: Include photos taken in different lighting conditions
- **Angles**: Front-facing, slight left/right rotations (avoid extreme angles)
- **Expressions**: Mix of neutral and smiling expressions
- **Clarity**: Ensure faces are not blurry or obscured
- **Background**: Prefer plain backgrounds but not required

### Optimal Training Strategy:
- **3-5 Photos**: Minimum for basic training
- **5-10 Photos**: Recommended for best accuracy
- **10+ Photos**: Diminishing returns, focus on quality over quantity

### Training Schedule:
- **Initial Training**: When first registering a student
- **Periodic Updates**: Retrain every 6-12 months or when appearance changes
- **Performance-Based**: Retrain if recognition accuracy drops

## üîç Integration with Existing System

### Automatic Integration:
- **Real-time Recognition**: Trained faces automatically work with live camera
- **Photo Recognition**: Enhanced accuracy for uploaded photos
- **Attendance System**: Better identification for automatic attendance marking

### Data Compatibility:
- **Existing Embeddings**: Maintains compatibility with previously registered faces
- **CSV Integration**: Training metadata stored separately, doesn't affect student data
- **Backup System**: Training data can be exported and restored

## üìä Performance Monitoring
